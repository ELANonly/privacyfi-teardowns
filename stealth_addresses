# Stealth Addresses Teardown

## 1. Problem Definition
A static public receiving address on a blockchain acts as a permanent identity beacon.  
Once shared, every payment to that address is publicly visible and linkable.  
Anyone can track incoming payments, estimate activity and income and monitor future transfers.  

Creating new addresses manually for each payment does not scale and breaks UX. Coordination off chain introduces mistakes, and users eventually reuse addresses.  
**Stealth addresses solve this problem** by allowing recipients to receive funds at fresh, unlinkable addresses while publishing a single public identifier.


## 2. How Privacy is Achieved and Trust Assumptions
Stealth addresses hide recipient identity by deriving **one time addresses** for each payment.  

- A recipient publishes a **public stealth identifier**, not a reusable address  
- A sender uses this identifier to locally derive a **unique destination address** for each transaction  
- The recipient scans the blockchain using a **private viewing key** to detect payments and derive the corresponding spending key  
- Observers see multiple unrelated addresses; the recipient knows which funds are theirs  

**Trust assumptions include:**  
- Wallets implement address derivation correctly  
- Recipients securely manage viewing keys  
- Blockchain scanning infrastructure works reliably  
- External metadata, network, or off chain context may still leak information


## 3. Limitations and Tradeoffs
- Only hides recipient identity; senders, amounts, and timing remain visible  
- Requires wallet support and correct implementation  
- Recipients must scan for payments, introducing operational overhead  
- Partial privacy only; does not replace mixers or ZK privacy systems  
- Adoption dependency; low adoption reduces effectiveness  
- Misuse can create a false sense of privacy


## 4. Common User Misconceptions
- **“Transactions are fully private”** – false  
- **“I am anonymous”** – false  
- **“No behavior change is required”** – false  
- **“Replaces mixers or ZK systems”** – false  
- **“Privacy is preserved after spending”** – false


## 5. User Suitability
**Recommended for:**  
- Users who want to receive funds without exposing a reusable address  
- Users comfortable with privacy-aware wallet practices  
- Builders designing systems with layered privacy  

**Not recommended for:**  
- Users expecting full transaction anonymity  
- Users unwilling to manage viewing keys or scan for payments  
- Users seeking maximum

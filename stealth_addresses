Stealth Addresses
What they are
Stealth addresses are a privacy technique that protects recipient identity on public blockchains.
They allow someone to publish a single public identifier while receiving funds to fresh, unlinkable addresses each time.
The blockchain shows normal transfers, but observers cannot easily tell that multiple payments went to the same recipient.
This solves recipient privacy, not transaction privacy.
The problem they solve
A static public address becomes a permanent identity beacon.
Once shared, anyone can: • Track all incoming payments
• Estimate income and activity
• Monitor future transfers
• Correlate behavior across time
Creating new addresses manually does not scale and breaks UX. Coordination moves off chain and users eventually reuse addresses.
Stealth addresses remove the need to reuse a receiving address.
How stealth addresses work
A recipient publishes a public stealth identifier, not a wallet address.
A sender uses this identifier to derive a one time destination address locally.
Each payment goes to a unique address that appears unrelated on chain.
The recipient scans the chain using a private viewing key to detect incoming payments and derive the spending key.
On chain, payments look random.
Off chain, the recipient knows which funds are theirs.
What this assumes
Wallets must implement derivation correctly.
Recipients must protect viewing keys.
Scanning infrastructure must be reliable.
Network metadata and off chain context can still leak identity. Stealth addresses do not protect against that.
What this does not solve
Stealth addresses do not: • Hide senders
• Hide amounts
• Hide timing
• Provide anonymity
They only remove address reuse and recipient linkability.
When they work best
Stealth addresses work best when: • Wallet support is native
• Users understand basic privacy hygiene
• Combined with other privacy tools
They are a building block, not a full privacy system.
